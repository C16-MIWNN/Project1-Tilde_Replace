# Use cases

The user Alices wants to see all the recipes she has saved. She goes to her
personal website and sees all her recipes. She see her favorite red curry and
clicks on that recipe link to see the full recipes.

She is send to the detail page of her red curry recipe, that shows first all
the ingredients she needs (because that is the most important things to know,
she might only need a reminder what goes in or what the quantities are, to
immediately decide if she can cook that today).

She sees that 10000 gram red meat goes into a dish for 1, which is clearly a
mistake. She needs to edit this, and clicks on the recipe edit button and is
sent to the recipe details form with all the values already filled in. She
corrects the wrong value and presses save to update the recipe database. She is
send back to the recipe of red curry.

Know she notices that 'onion' is missing from the recipe. She presses 'edit
recipe' again and is sent to the recipe form again. There she wants to add the
'onion' (how?) however this ingredient is not yet in the database. She presses
'new ingredient' and is sent to a 'new ingredient form' and adds the union under
its name and the apropriate values. She presses the save button and is sent back
to the edit form of the red curry. The onion is automatically added and she now
saves the recipe.

She sees she has all the ingredients and looks down the page that shows how the
meal needs to be prepared.
